# miniGPT
You can build your own GPT model from scratch with this project.
It's based on the famous NanoGPT project: https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT , I removed the section for multiple GPUs and optimized the training part to suit for training with single GPU. And I optimized the model part with some nice design from Llama model architecture. Supported training on openwebtext datasets or other txt resources, you can try it with your preferred dataset.
